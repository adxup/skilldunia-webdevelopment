    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at
      least want to make sure they are
      <strong>equipped with a template</strong> that gives them a fighting
      chance to produce effective website content that drives action.
    </p>

    <a href="#">
      <img
        src="images/family.png"
        width="100px"
        height="70px"
        alt="family"
        title="family"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website content strategy
      <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">(that we slaved over)</a>
      into an ineffective <u>“brochure site”</u> gives me heartburn. But
      sometimes you have to pick your battles.

    <h3>Website content template components</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Pre-writing questions</i>: Before starting any given page, you really
      need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom
      this page is targeted. <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
