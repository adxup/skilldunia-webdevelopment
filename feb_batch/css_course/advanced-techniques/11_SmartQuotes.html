      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage,
      <q>If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,</q> can be a
      two-way street.
    </p>

      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website <q>content strategy (that we slaved over)</q> into an ineffective
      “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
      battles.
