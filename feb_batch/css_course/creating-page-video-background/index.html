          Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need
          to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom
          this page is targeted. What’s their pain? What’s in it for them? Where
          are they in their buying process? And what keywords or phrases would
          they most likely use to search for your solution? The best writers are
          those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and write as if they
          are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
