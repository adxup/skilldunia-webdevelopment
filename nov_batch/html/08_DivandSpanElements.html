        Over the years of <a href="#">developing websites</a> for clients, I’ve
        learned that the age-old adage,
        <strong
          >“If you want <span>it done right</span>, you gotta do it
          yourself,”</strong
        >
        can be a two-way street.
      </p>

        Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
        internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a
        <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">company turning</a> a great
        website content strategy <u>(that we slaved over)</u> into an
        ineffective <i>“brochure site”</i> gives me heartburn. But sometimes you
        have to pick your battles.
