            <p>
              Despite the intelligence level of your site visitors, people don’t
              want to have to think when they are browsing websites. Obvious
              command-oriented calls to action are key in moving visitors
              through your website. And don’t be scared to make the call to
              action a BIG BUTTON. Bigger is better, but don’t make it look like
              a banner.

              Finally, the template includes a checklist of items and reminders
              you can use to ensure your page is good to go. Of these items, I
              think the most important one is to just get another set of
              eyeballs on it. If you’re writing the page, you’re now too close
              to it and no longer qualified to edit it.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you start using this template, realize that not every page on
              your site has to follow this exact format. Modify your web content
              structure and formatting so that it accomplishes the goals of the
              page. When in doubt, test.
