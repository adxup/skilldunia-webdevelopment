    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of <a href="#">developing websites</a> for clients, I’ve
      learned that the age-old adage,
      <strong>“If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”</strong>
      can be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a
      <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">company turning</a> a great
      website content strategy <u>(that we slaved over)</u> into an ineffective
      <i>“brochure site”</i> gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick
      your battles.

    <h3>Website content template components</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Pre-writing questions:</strong> Before starting any given page,
      you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and
      to whom this page is targeted. <br />
      <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br />
      <br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
