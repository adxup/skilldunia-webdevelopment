    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can
      be a two-way street.

      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
      “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
      battles.
