      <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

      <p>
        Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
        age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”
        can be a two-way street.
      </p>

        Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
        internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
        website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
        “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
        battles.
