        <h1>Calls to action:</h1>

        <p>
          Despite the intelligence level of your site visitors, people don’t
          want to have to think when they are browsing websites. Obvious
          command-oriented calls to action are key in moving visitors through
          your website. And don’t be scared to make the call to action a
          <span>BIG BUTTON</span>. Bigger is better, but don’t make it look like
          a banner.
        </p>

        <h3>Post-writing checklist</h3>

        <p class="contentType">
          Finally, the template includes a checklist of items and reminders you
          can use to ensure your page is good to go. Of these items, I think the
          most important one is to just get another set of eyeballs on it. If
          you’re writing the page, you’re now too close to it and no longer
          qualified to edit it.
