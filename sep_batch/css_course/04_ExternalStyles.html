      <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

      <p>
        Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
        age-old adage,
        <span>“If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”</span>
        can be a two-way street.
      </p>

      <div><img src="images/clipart.png" /></div>

      <div><img src="images/illustration.png" /></div>

      <div><img src="images/photo.png" /></div>

      <p>
        In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we
        at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives
        them a fighting chance to produce effective website content that drives
        action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s
        included.

      <h3>Website content template components</h3>

      <p>
        Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need
        to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this
        page is targeted. <br />
        <br />
        What’s their pain? <br />
        What’s in it for them? <br />
        Where are they in their buying process? <br />
        And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for
        your solution? <br /><br />
        The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes
        and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that
        buyer.
