        Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
        internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
        website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
        “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
        battles.

        In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we
        at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives
        them a fighting chance to produce effective website content that drives
        action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s
        included.
