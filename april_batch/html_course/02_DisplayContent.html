    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage,
      <strong
        >“If you want it done right, you gotta
        <a href="#">do it yourself</a>,”</strong
      >
      can be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <a href="#"
      ><img
        src="images/banner.jpg"
        width="110px"
        height="50px"
        title="banner"
        alt="banner"
        align="left"
    /></a>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website content strategy <u>(that we slaved over)</u> into an ineffective
      <strong>“brochure site”</strong> gives me heartburn. But sometimes you
      have to pick your battles.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at
      least want to <i>make sure they are equipped</i> with a template that
      gives them a fighting chance to produce effective website content that
      drives action. Here is a
      <a href="01_GettingStarted.html">template we like to use</a> , and an
      explanation of what’s included.
    </p>

    <a href="#"
      ><img
        src="images/banner.jpg"
        width="110px"
        height="50px"
        title="banner"
        alt="banner"
        align="right"
    /></a>

    <p>
      <strong>Pre-writing questions:</strong> Before starting any given page,
      you really need to wrap your heads around the
      <a href="http://google.de" target="_blank" title="goal"
        >primary goal of the page</a
      >
      and to whom this page is targeted. <br /><br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br /><br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
