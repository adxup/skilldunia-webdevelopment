    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” can
      be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great
      website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
      “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your
      battles.

    <h3>Website content template components</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Pre - questions:</strong> <br />
      Before starting any given page, you really need to wrap your heads around
      the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted. <br />
      <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br />
      <br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
