      Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need to
      wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page
      is targeted. What’s their pain? What’s in it for them? Where are they in
      their buying process? And what keywords or phrases would they most likely
      use to search for your solution? The best writers are those who can put
      themselves in the buyer’s shoes and write as if they are having a
      one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
