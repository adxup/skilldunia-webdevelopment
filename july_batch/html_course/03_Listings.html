        As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a
        page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO
        aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a headline and
        programming the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice
        Google juice.

        Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused
        sub-headlines can really boost the odds that your page will be read. I
        like to run a “scan test” on every page to see if I can get the gist of
        page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action.

        I’ve always had an interest in neuropsychology, and I couldn’t help but
        devour Susan Weinschenk’s book, Neuro Web Design back in 2009.
        Throughout the book she talks about how we subconsciously process
        everything we see on a website, but she summarizes that “stories and
        pictures are the most powerful ways to get and hold our attention and
        persuade us to take action.”Let’s not forget about Google. Optimizing
        your image’s file name and alt tag with a keyword/phrase provides the
        context Google needs and validates the relevance of your page.
