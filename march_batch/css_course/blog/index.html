        <p>
          Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that
          the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it
          yourself,” can be a two-way street.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
          internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a
          great website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an
          ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have
          to pick your battles.
