    <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage,
      <strong>“If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,”</strong>
      can be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a
      <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">company turning</a> a great
      website content strategy <u> (that we slaved over) </u> into an
      ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to
      pick your battles.

    <h3>Website content template components</h3>

    <p>
      Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need to
      wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page
      is targeted. <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at
      least want to make sure they are
      <i> equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance </i> to
      produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template
      we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.
